Grade 12 Computer Science Project

This was a game programmed by myself, with menu graphics being done by me and pixel art being done by Derek Chylinski.  
It was the final project for our Grade 12 AP Computer Science class.  

The game is meanet to be a rough clone of Fire Emblem.  Much more was planned before, with more interesting abilities and
other mechanics that would seperate it from being a simple clone, however due to time constraints we were unable 
to do so.  

A hope for the future is to recreate our old idea in Android, as the game would work well on a Tablet.
